# BookStore
Introduction: 
A local book store has a need to track books that are on display in their store window. Each book has a unique ID, the book title, the year the book was published and the monetary value of the book (in Pounds sterling). The book store window will only display one copy of each book.


Objectives:
- Define classes, fields, constructors, and methods in Java
- Use appropriate types, including collections
- Implement basic algorithms using collections
- Write a main method including console and file input/output

Methods to find and return:
- The object representing the book with the highest value.
- The object representing the oldest book displayed in the window.
- The average value of all books.

The main method does the following:
- Presents the user with a menu (printed to the console) of options:
  1) Enter the name of the book store
  2) Read in information on the books from a .csv file in the current directory called books.csv.
  3) Print a summary of the book store name followed by a list of all books, their value and the year published to the console.
  4) Print statistics on books, showing the full details of the book with the highest value, oldest book displayed in the window, and average         value of books displayed in the window of the book store, to the console
- Takes user input from the console to choose one of the menu options.
- After executing one of the features, returns the user to the menu to choose another option.
